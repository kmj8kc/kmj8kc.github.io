                    <h3>Some hopeful quotes for a hopeful person:</h3>
                   	<p>"Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be." <b>~Shel Silverstein</b></p>
			<p>"You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us. And the world will live as one." <b>~John Lennon</b></p>
			<p>"I used to think I was the strangest person in the world
but then I thought, there are so many people in the world, there must be someone just like me who feels bizarre and flawed in the same ways I do
I would imagine her, and imagine that she must be out there thinking of me too.
well, I hope that if you are out there you read this and know that yes, it’s true I’m here, and I’m just as strange as you." <b>~Rebecca Katherine Martin</b></p>
			<p>"When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too." <b>~Paulo Coelho</b></p>
			<p>"You can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep Spring from coming." <b>~Pablo Neruda</b></p>
