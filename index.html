	<h2>Life can be difficult and your emotions matter!</h2>
<p>You can pick your current emotions below, and allow yourself to navigate them with the help of literature and film. We will suggest a few books along with a movie recommendations. You will also have a space to post a daily, disappearing journal entry that will allow you to express yourself and release those emotions into the void (or more like the cloud).</p>
<p>I hope you always know that you are seen and you are heard.</p>

            <h2>To Set The Tone</h2>
<p>This scene is from one of my favorite TV Shows called Fleabag. The show is in the perspective of the main character: Fleabag and her journey towards self-discovery and inner confidence. This scene resonates to me because it makes one realize that sometimes all we truly need is some guidance or, at least, a listening ear</p>
<p>We want to be just that. Your helping hand or listening ear.</p>
