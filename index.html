            <h3>To Set The Tone</h3>
<p>This scene is from one of my favorite TV Shows called Fleabag. The show is in the perspective of the main character: Fleabag and her journey towards self-discovery and inner confidence. This scene resonates to me because it makes one realize that sometimes all we truly need is some guidance or, at least, a listening ear</p>
<p>We want to be just that. Your helping hand or listening ear.</p>
