                    <h3>Some quotes to spark creativity:</h3>
                   	<p>"The visionary starts with a clean sheet of paper, and re-imagines the world." <b>~Malcolm Gladwell</b></p>
			<p>"To be creative means to be in love with life. You can be creative only if you love life enough that you want to enhance its beauty, you want to bring a little more music to it, a little more poetry to it, a little more dance to it." <b>~Osho</b></p>
			<p>"You have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want to right. If you're not passionate enough from the start, you'll never stick it out." <b>~Steve Jobs</b></p>
			<p>"The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: A human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. To him... a touch is a blow, a sound is a noise, a misfortune is a tragedy, a joy is an ecstasy, a friend is a lover, a lover is a god, and failure is death. Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to create, create, create -- so that
without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning, his very breath is cut off from him. He must create, must pour out creation. By some strange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating." <b>~Pearl S. Buck</b></p>
			<p>"Everybody is talented because everybody who is human has something to express." <b>~Brenda Ueland</b></p>
