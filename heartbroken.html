                    <h3>Shall We Indulge In Our Emotions With Some Quotes?</h3>
                   	<p>"Let them leave: you deserve someone who wants to stay." <b>~Faraway</b></p>
			<p>"It's extremely important to realize that you are beautiful before someone noticed and you'll remain beautiful in their absence. Your beauty is not subjected to who values you for it" <b>~Unknown</b></p>
			<p>"Sometimes the hero stumbles and falls right off of the page. Sometimes the princess rolls her eyes and says "I don't want to be saved." Sometimes the dragon needs rescuing and the villain aches to be helped. Sometimes, in the darkness. The lost boy finds himself. Sometimes the prince is cunning and not at all what he seemed. Sometimes the witch's kindness shows its she who deserves to be queen. Sometimes we shouldn't define people by someone else's point of view. Just because it's what we've been told, doesn't make it true." <b>~srwpoetry</b></p>
			<p>"I looked at him one last time as he looked past me, at her. I was his ghost, disguised as someone real. Someone who could stand in front of love and let it haunt her. Until it finally faded her away like the unwanted spectator she was" <b>~Poemsfromher</b></p>
			<p>"She asked 'you are in love, what does love look like' to which I replied 'like everything I lost come back to me" <b>~Unknown</b></p>
