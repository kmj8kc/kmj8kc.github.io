                   	<p>"She never needed to be saved, but she thought it would be nice to have someone every once in a while come to pick her up off the ground when felt nothing but defeated" <b>~Kayil York</b></p>
			<p>"The best thing about rock bottom is the rock part. You discover the solid bit of you. The bit that can't be broken down further. The thing that you might sentimentally call a soul. At our lowest we fine the solid ground of our foundation. And we can build ourselves anew" <b>~Unknown</b></p>
			<p>"These are the days that must happen to you." <b>~Walt Whitman</b></p>
			<p>"There are losses that rearrange the world. Deaths that change the way you see everything, grief that tears everything down. Pain that transports you to an entirely different universe, even while everyone else thinks nothing has really changed." <b>~Megan Devine</b></p>
			<p>"And find the place where every single thing you see tells you to stay." <b>~Seeker</b></p>
