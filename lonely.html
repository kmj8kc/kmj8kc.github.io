                    <h3>Shall we indulge in our emotions with some quotes (both reflective and encouraging) ?</h3>
                   	<p>"And all I loved. I loved alone." <b>~Edgar Allan Poe</b></p>
			<p>"Loneliness, is a fire, which I hold close to my skin, to see how much pain I can stand, before running to the water." <b>~Atticus</b></p>
			<p>"To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all." <b>~Oscar Wilde</b></p>
			<p>"I like being alone. I have control over my own space. Therefore, in order to win me over, your presence has to beg better than my solitude. You're not competing with another person, you are competing with my comfort zone." <b>~Horacio Jones</b></p>
			<p>"Life manifested itself like a staggered piece of art. Everything seemingly misplaced scattered around like raindrops after a whirlwind. She existed somewhere beyond it all, stepping into each drop trying to find its sequence, its message. But Life continued to be, letting its raindrops sit in their disorder. Abstract until it was ready to reveal itself. When it was time." <b>~Shruti Prakash</b></p>
