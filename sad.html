                    <h3>How would you identify your current emotions?</h3>
                    <p>I heard a analogy one time about the purpose of an electron in a single atom. An atom is the basic building block of all matter. Everything is made up of atoms! In its center, there are smaller particles called protons (the positive particles) and neutrons (the neutral particles). There is, however, one more particle that exists outside of the center of the atom and revolves around it, the electron (the negative particle). Even in nature, negativity is present and accepted. After all, it does make up all matter. However, it stays floating around the outside of the center of the atom. Sadness and negative emotions are no different than that. They exist as naturally and commonly as any other happier or neutral feeling. Although, they don't have to reside in the core of your being. Let is dwell on the outside.</p>
