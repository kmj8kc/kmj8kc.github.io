                    <h3>Some Quotes That Speak About The Beauty Of Balance: </h3>
                   	<p>"What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter - a soothing, calming influence on the mind, rather like a good armchair which provides relaxation from physical fatigue." <b>~Henri Matisse</b></p>
			<p>"There are moments when i wish i could roll back the clock and take all the sadness away, but i have a feeling that if i did, the joy would be gone as well. So i take the memories as they come, accepting them all, letting them guide me whenever i can." <b>~Nicholas Sparks</b></p>
			<p>"Somehow, we'll find it. The balance between whom we wish to be and whom we need to be. But for now, we simply have to be satisfied with who we are." <b>~Brandon Sanderson</b></p>
			<p>"I see a world on the edge of a blade. Without balance, it will fall." <b>~Victoria Aveyard</b></p>
			<p>"SMy point is, life is about balance. The good and the bad. The highs and the lows. The pina and the colada." <b>~Ellen Degeneres</b></p>
