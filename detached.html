                    <h3>Some quotes speak about the beauty of being detached:</h3>
                   	<p>"Attachment is the great fabricator of illusions; reality can be obtained only by someone who is detached." <b>~Simone Weil</b></p>
			<p>"It's life that matters, nothing but life—the process of discovering, the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself, at all." <b>~Fyodor Dostoyevsky</b></p>
			<p>"Take any emotion—love for a woman, or grief for a loved one, or what I’m going through, fear and pain from a deadly illness. If you hold back on the emotions—if you don’t allow yourself to go all the way through them—you can never get to being detached, you’re too busy being afraid. You’re afraid of the pain, you’re afraid of the grief. You’re afraid of the vulnerability that loving entails. “But by throwing yourself into these emotions, by allowing yourself to dive in, all the way, over your head even, you experience them fully and completely. You know what pain is. You know what love is. You know what grief is. And only then can you say, ‘All right. I have experienced that emotion. I recognize that emotion. Now I need to detach from that emotion for a moment’." <b>~Mitch Albom</b></p>
			<p>"They should tell you when you’re born: have a suitcase heart, be ready to travel." <b>~Gabrielle Zevin</b></p>
			<p>"I’ll detach myself from the crowd if it hinders my growth,
I’ll fall from the tree that won’t let me grow." <b>~Hareem Ch</b></p>
